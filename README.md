Hackathon 1 contains
          
          1. AWS CC.PDF and output results screenshots
          2. Integration 1 - Create a GET method with query parameters to call lambda function.
          3. Integration 2 - Create a POST method with a Json payload to call the Lambda function.
          4. Integration 3 - Create a GET method with path parameters to call the Lambda function.
          5. Also a video of all 3 integrations

Hackathon 2 contains
          
          1. Output results screenshots 
          2. Input files and python files
          3. Also a video how we done.

Transfering Files through FileZilla
  
        Contains screenshots of outputs, how we transferd the files to an EC2 instance through filezilla

AWS Cloud9 Environment 

        First I created an cloud9 environment and for that i added an IAM role for accessing all the permissions. Then I stand up an AWS Cloud9 development environment, and created first AWS Lambda code in the cloud with AWS Chalice.
        We'll be using a Python framework for AWS called AWS Chalice, which makes coding, connecting, testing, and deploying these components real easy.
        This folder contains the screen shots of the outputs which tells how i created an virtual environment called chalice and running an python program for invoking an lambda function.

AWS Sagemaker

        This folder contains the output results of the machine learning code (i.e; Linear Regression model) using jupiter notebook for predicting the weather using the previous years one year data set.
        This is an small weather prediction project done using AWS Sagemaker.
        folder contains 
        1. An .ipynb files (i.e code for the project)
        2. An Dataset in the form of .csv
        3. A pdf showing the results
        4. And output screenshots

Other platform Cloud work

        We also worked on an other platform like AWS, i.e; Google Qwicklabs
        As all other cloud platfroms like AZURE, OPEN STACK, INTEL DEV ETC. all these platforms are not free and also we need to have an high end PC to run all these virtual instances.
        So, i enrolled for an Program called Google facilitator program which offer the two months subscription to work on this platform.
        This folder contains the 
        1. Screen shots of the work doing on qwicklabs.
